<h1 style="text-align: center;">ABOUT ME</h1>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">السَّلاَمُ عَلَيْكُمْ وَرَحْمَةُ اللهِ وَبَرَكَاتُهُ</h2>

<p>Do you know that there are two personality kinds in this world—introvert and extrovert—among my lovely, attractive, and attractive readers? Every living thing in the world possesses these personalities. I am 20% outgoing and 80% introverted at the outset of my introduction.</p>

<p>Although both of my parents decided on a lovely name, I didn't enjoy it when I was younger and in elementary school as I didn't know what it meant. And then, suddenly, I was learning Arabic in high school and understood its significance. I also loved my name, Mior Muhammad Firdaus Bin Muhamad Fadzli. Friends and family just call me Mior. My entire family refers to me as Adik.

<p>I enjoy sketching and cartoons. I enjoy gathering my favourite anime characters and watching them. Even if it's fiction, it passes the time and helps me forget certain issues. My favourite character is definitely <a href="https://dragonball.fandom.com/wiki/Goku">Son Goku. The anime name 'Dragonball' and I really love the soundtrack.</a></p>

<p>When I was a child, my dream was to become a teacher, but I was not good in starting relationship with people. Eventhough I have weakness, I still love to share my knowlegde with everyone.I really have a deep passion in teaching. Although it sounds sad, I am still learning about how to start a relation and conversation with stranger. I also want to feel like a mentor even if the chance is only 10%.</p>
